# NMRee
Calculates the relationship between NMR peak integral and enantiomeric excess under conditions in which racemisation corresponds to exchange of hydrogen with solvent protons/deuteria, and the solvent is not necessarily in large excess.

Example data is the output for:
Exchangeable hydrogens (equiv):3
Solvent deuterons (equiv):5
Solvent protons (equiv):1
Initial enantiomeric excess (%):100
